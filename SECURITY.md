# Security Policy

This security policy outlines how security vulnerabilities should be reported and handled for FlashLec. We take security seriously and appreciate the community's efforts in helping maintain a secure project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

If you discover a potential vulnerability:

- Do **not** create a public issue.
- Use the **"Report a vulnerability"** feature under the "Security" tab of this repository to privately notify maintainers.
- If this feature is not available, please look for alternative private communication channels provided by the project.

Confirmed vulnerabilities will be addressed as quickly as possible. Security fixes may be released as patch versions or included in the next scheduled release.

## Responsible Disclosure

- Please avoid publicly disclosing details of a vulnerability until it has been fixed.
- Do not exploit security issues for malicious purposes.
- Provide clear steps to reproduce the issue when reporting.
